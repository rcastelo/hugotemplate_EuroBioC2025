If you are traveling internationally, we recommend flying into either [Birmingham International Airport][birminghamairport] or [Heathrow Airport][heathrow], or taking the [Eurostar][eurostar].

## Airports

### Birmingham International Airport

[Birmingham International Airport][birminghamairport] offers a direct hourly train service to Oxford, with a travel time of approximately one hour.

### Heathrow Airport

From [Heathrow Airport][heathrow], you can take the convenient [Oxford Airline](https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/oxford-to-heathrow-bus/) bus, departing every 20 minutes.
The journey takes around 90 minutes.
Card payments are accepted on board and flexible return options are available; it is not necessary to book in advance.

Please note:

- Terminal 5 arrivals have direct access to the bus stand, while other terminals require a 15-20 minute walk to the central bus station.
- Check the screens for the bus stand and keep an eye out for buses displaying the OXF bus code, as there are several in operation at Heathrow Airport.
- The bus has a premium feel and large luggage is stored underneath; small bags and backpacks can be brought onboard.
- We do not recommend traveling by train from [Heathrow Airport][heathrow] but there are direct services from [London Paddington][london-paddington] which you can get to on the [Underground][tube] ("Tube") service using the [Elizabeth ("Purple") line][elizabeth-line] from [Heathrow Airport][heathrow]. 

## Train

### Eurostar

If traveling by Eurostar, arrive at [London St Pancras][stpancras] station and take the westbound underground service (the [circle line][circle], indicated by yellow on the [map][tube-map]) to [Paddington][london-paddington].
From there, direct train services to Oxford are available.

Additionally, less frequent direct services are offered from Marylebone station.

Alternatively, there is a bus service known as the [Oxford tube][oxfordtube] serving [several stops][oxfordtube-stops] across London, including [London Victoria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ic5FY52sxmjnuCZ6A), [Marble Arch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JRbGWqgEQkKV7iTw6), [Notting Hill Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXd5eb6yBJ3k8z6C9), and [Shepherd's Bush](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E9PZUERvoiErgRiB6).
The bus stops for this bus can be difficult to recognise in the busy London streets; the links provide their location in Google Maps.
