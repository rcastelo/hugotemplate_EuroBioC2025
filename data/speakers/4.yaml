text: "I am a junior group leader in computational biology at the MRC Center for Computational Biology and MRC Translational Immune Discovery Unit at MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational biology and human immunology, in particular in the applications of â€˜omics, single cell and spatial technologies for the better understanding of tissue microenvironment, local tissue dynamics and cellular interactions, how they are established during development, and the molecular perturbations and tissue remodelling that occurs in disease states, in particular in autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. In order to address these types of questions, my research focuses on inter-disciplinary expertise in both biology and computational biology to both to extract relevant biological insights from complex datasets and to develop domain-tailored machine learning models and novel computational methods for high-dimensional sequencing data analysis.<br/><br/>Website: https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=xGG5fY4AAAAJ&hl=en"
