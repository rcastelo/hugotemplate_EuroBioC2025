text: "Altuna Akalin is a bioinformatics scientist and the head of Bioinformatics and Omics Data Science Platform at the Berlin Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbrück Center in Berlin. He has been developing computational methods for analyzing and integrating large-scale genomics data sets since 2002. He mainly uses machine learning and statistics to uncover patterns related to important biological variables such as disease state and type. He spent some time in the USA, Norway, Turkey, Japan, and Switzerland in order to pursue research work and education related to statistics, machine learning and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>The underlying aim of his current work is utilizing complex molecular signatures to provide decision support systems for disease diagnostics and biomarker discovery. In addition to the research efforts and managing a scientific lab, since 2015, he has been organizing and teaching at computational genomics courses in Berlin with participants from across the world.<br/><br/>Website: https://al2na.co/."
