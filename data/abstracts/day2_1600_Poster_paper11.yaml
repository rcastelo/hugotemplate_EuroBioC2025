abstract: "Abstract :  Background Tumor invasiveness reflects numerous biological changes, including tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis. To decipher the role of transcriptional regulators (TR) involved in tumor invasiveness, we performed a systematic network-based pan-cancer assessment of master regulators of cancer invasiveness.  Materials and methods : We stratified patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into invasiveness high (INV-H) and low (INV-L) groups using consensus clustering based on an established robust 24-gene signature to determine the prognostic association of invasiveness with overall survival (OS) across 32 different cancers. We devise a network-based protocol to identify TRs as master regulators (MRs) unique to INV-H and INV-L phenotypes. We validated the activity of MRs coherently associated with INV-H phenotype and worse OS across cancers in TCGA on a series of additional datasets in the Prediction of Clinical Outcomes from the Genomic Profiles (PRECOG) repository. Results Based on the 24-gene signature, we defined the invasiveness score for each patient sample and stratified patients into INV-H and INV-L clusters. We observed that invasiveness was associated with worse survival outcomes in almost all cancers and had a significant association with OS in ten out of 32 cancers. Our network-based framework identified common invasiveness-associated MRs specific to INV-H and INV-L groups across the ten prognostic cancers, including COL1A1, which is also part of the 24-gene signature, thus acting as a positive control. Downstream pathway analysis of MRs specific to INV-H phenotype resulted in the identification of several enriched pathways, including Epithelial into Mesenchymal Transition, TGF-β signaling pathway, regulation of Toll-like receptors, cytokines, and inflammatory response, and selective expression of chemokine receptors during T-cell polarization. Most of these pathways have connotations of inflammatory immune response and feasibility for metastasis.  Conclusion :  Our pan-cancer study provides a comprehensive master regulator analysis of tumor invasiveness and can suggest more precise therapeutic strategies by targeting the identified MRs and downstream enriched pathways for patients across multiple cancers.
