### Known Issue
We have been informed of fraudulent emails regarding accommodation bookings for the conference. These emails request your arrival and departure dates to finalise your reservation and then send an invoice.

This type of scam has been reported at other conferences as well, for example, [here](https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2024/02/12/yet-another-conference-scam/).
