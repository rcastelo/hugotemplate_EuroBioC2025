## Submission types

### Flashtalk

Flashtalks are very short presentations (5 min or less) that may be submitted up until the day of the session, granted on a first come, first served basis.

Please refer to the [conference schedule](../schedule/) for the date and time of the flashtalk session.

Slides must be either publicly accessible online or uploaded to a shared Google Drive.
Presenters will not be allowed to connect their own laptop.
We advise presenters to keep presentations simple (e.g., avoid animations where possible).

Conference delegates already scheduled to present a short talk or poster are welcome to submit flashtalks.
