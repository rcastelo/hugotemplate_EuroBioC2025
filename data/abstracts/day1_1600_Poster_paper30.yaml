abstract: "In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of proteomics data analysis. However, the complexity of workflows involving programming languages such as R and Python can pose challenges for practitioners without any coding backgrounds. To address this issue, we introduce two user-friendly packages: *scpGUI* and *QFeaturesGUI*.  *scpGUI* is tailored for downstream visual analysis in single-cell proteomics, using the outcomes of the popular package *scp*. Developed using *Shiny* and built upon the elegant and efficient *iSEE* suite, *scpGUI* offers interactive data visualisations specifically crafted for single-cell proteomics downstream analysis. The app's interactivity helps users in comprehending their results through various visualisations.  Similarly, *QFeaturesGUI* is designed for single-cell and bulk proteomics analysis, capitalising on the strengths of the *QFeatures* package. Providing a suite of *Shiny* apps, *QFeaturesGUI* offers comprehensive tools for data import and basic processing steps, simplifying pre-treatment of quantitative proteomics data. Its modular design ensures flexibility and adaptability to specific requirements. These apps also enhance transparency and facilitate replication by generating reproducible R code.  Together, *scpGUI* and *QFeaturesGUI* offer valuable support for proteomics data analysis. By combining user-friendly graphical interfaces with powerful back-end tools, they make advanced analysis techniques more accessible to the wider proteomics community."
